# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# puts 'Creating...'
# Journey.create(starting_point: '16 Villa Gaudelet, Paris', ending_point: 'Antony', footprint: '3000g', duration: '30min', date: '05/06/2019', user_id: 1)

# puts 'Finished!'
